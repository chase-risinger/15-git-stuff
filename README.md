## Purpose
An online database in which products are stored.  The user creates a listing, sets a price and gives a short description of the product.  Users emails are displayed so that other users can contact them in regards to the product.

## Process
In order to complete this project in the most efficient manner we first reviewed the various strengths and weaknesses of the team members, in order to determine who was the best fit for each aspect of the project. The greatest challenge that we faced was managing time around each team memberâ€™s individual schedule. With differing work schedules and holidays, the times when all team members were simultaneously available were limited. Our communication and commitment to working together collaboratively enabled us to successfully manage our time-related challenges and complete this project on schedule.

## Future
Iterations of this project could enhance the user experience by providing more detailed Categories (e.g. sporting goods, musical instruments, video games etc.), Images (uploading them, storing them in a database), Condition (new, like-new, good, fair), and Location based (search based on where you are in the world).


## Installation 
The user would need to use the following dependencies to insatll this app, which are: mysql, sequelize, express-session, express-handlebars, bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, express, handlebars, and dotenv.

## Usage
In order for the application to be used, the user would need the command-line, mysql, and npm.

## Tests
To perform tests, the user would need insomnia to check if all the routes functionality work properly.
